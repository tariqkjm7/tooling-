# task 1 

their is a company that sales tickets for their customers called **Keep N Touch**
the company was having a problem with sailing the tickets for the company Events 
so they ask us to create a web-based application to solve this problem by using a new website 
also, the stake holders ask us some specific things to do in this project 

**some of the requirements:**

* Home button 
* about us 
* side bar contains company name and GitHub page link.
* cart 






 ### **We faced some challenges(risks) while we are working in the code:**



* Code quality 
* Time management 
* Code conflicts 
* Not ready to use the Available tools 
* Changing the plan many times
* We faced a problem with the code in some points 
* the most important thing is the compant don't want to confuse their customers by changing the regular work to use the website 
* we were strugling with the compant with the website desgin.





## **requirements brief**
In short, the company ask us to do full website that allows the users to buy tickets for the company events and having a tickets page that shows them the ticket they bought. also, allows them to remove any tickets if they change their mind in that event 
For the design the company ask for a side bar that contains the logo, name of the website and a GitHub logo that drive the users to the company GitHub organization 
also, asked for contact us page so they can have any feedback from the website visitors to have any improvement in the future.
Also, as a user they want to full details about the event so they can choose from the events that the company have.
As a user they want to have a cart page so that they can list all of the tickets bought so they can refer to that page and see the tickets in details.
And so many user stories that was in brief for them 
we also added the cart that shows every thing for the user. 







## **for the implementation technique we used agile and here is some information about agile**

**Agile:** is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. rather than betting everything on the "Big Bang" launch, an agile team delivers the add small but expendable increments. Requirements, plans, and outcomes are continually evaluated so teams have a natural mechanism to reply to vary quickly.





### **agile advantages**
* Superior quality product 
* Customer satisfaction
* Better control 
* Improved project predictability
* Reduced risks
* Increased flexibility
* Improved team morale

 for the testing we didn't complete it yet.
 ### **note:** 


 
 **you will find the testing solution in stage (3)**






   ### 
   **in task 2.2** we descripe the deffrints between these tools 
   but now we will talk about why we used them to solve our problem.
   we used them becuase:

   * these tools allows us to use the **SSH KEYS** to protect our copyRights.
   * also, to work on the project as a group and use project managment tool that already in the GitHub.
   * we used vs code to get benfit from the bulid in tools. 
   * linux open source. 
   * also get benefits from the tools in linux. 
   * we can manage the group by GITHUB tools. 
   * for the lunix it's much faster than windows. 
   * vs code it's easy to connect to the vertual machine platform.
