## Visual studio code
**Visual studio code (VS code)**:  
Visual Studio Code:  is the best text editor from Microsoft. The editor is free and open-source also works on many Operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The editor is based on the Electron environment and was launched by Microsoft in April 2015.


**Supported programming languages:**

Visual Studio Code mainly supports many diverse programming languages because it is not limited to a specific field. One of the languages supported in this editor is C and C++, not to mention Microsoft C#. It also supports popular web languages, Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML), CSS, and JavaScript. It also supports many Backend languages and many others. . The editor also has plugins to support more languages if the language is not already supported.





## PyCharm:
PyCharm: is an integrated development environment used for computer programming, specifically Python programming. The software produced by the Czech company JetBrains provides code analysis, graphical error detection, built-in unit testing tools, integration with audit control systems, Django web development support, and workflow. on Anaconda data science applications.



**Supported programming languages:**


Paycharm is cross-platform software; It can work on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The community edition is licensed under the Apache license and there is a professional version with more exclusive licensed features.

## Linux:


It is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems supported the Linux kernel.
A software system kernel first released on September ,1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in an exceedingly Linux distribution.
Distributions include the Linux kernel, system software, and supporting libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their names, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to stress the importance of the GNU software.




Linux also works on embedded systems, which are devices with an operating system installed on the device, and Linux is designed largely with these systems. This range includes routers, automatic controls, televisions, digital recorders, game players and smart watches. Many smartphones and tablets run on Android, which is a Linux-based system. With Android dominating the smartphone market, Linux is the most stable operating system.


## Windows:


Windows is a computer operating system developed by Microsoft with the aim of running personal computers, an operating system that includes the first GUI-type user interface for computers, is compatible with IBM, and currently the Windows operating system is dominated by the computer market, versions of Windows are used by 90%.




Microsoft calls most of its products with one word, which is why you often need one word to best describe the interface of the operating system used. At the same time, in more detail, the operating system was launched with the name “Microsoft Windows” due to the inability to trademark such a well-known name as “Microsoft”.

## GitHub:
It's an open source "repository" hosting service, used mostly for computer code in a variety of different programming languages, and keeps track of the different changes made to each iteration. The service is able to do this using git: the revision control system that runs in the command interface.



**What are its uses?**


It is used to store code for a project and keep track of all changes made to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools to manage potential conflicting changes from multiple developers. Developers are allowed to change, develop, and improve software from their public repositories for free, but private repositories are charged, each public or private repository contains all project files, as well as each file's previous version history, and repositories can contain multiple collaborators.



## GitLab: 

It is another alternative to GitHub, another spoofing site with a web service and version control system that is also based on Git. Of course, it is designed to host open source projects and to make life easier for developers, but there are some differences from its predecessor.
This site in addition to repository management and version control also provides wiki hosting and bug tracking system. A complete suite for creating and managing projects of all kinds, since, like GitHub, projects that go beyond source code are currently hosted.



**What are its uses?**


Git Lab is available in two licenses (EE) and (CE), the EE license is a paid license (but can be used entirely legally without a license) and the (CE) version is completely free. Using GitLab EE instead of GitLab CE gives us a lot of advantages, although we don't have a license to use the paid features in GitLab EE now, but installing GitLab EE gives us this ability later, but if we use GitLab CE and in the future we want to get any of the features We will only be able to install the system on another new server.



## **Why we chose GitHub, Linux, and vsCode?**

**GitHub advantages:**
* Free service, although it also offers paid services
* Very fast search in repos structure.
